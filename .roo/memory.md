## Architecture

### Application Overview
This is a Hebrew Bible learning game focused on Genesis 1. Users type Hebrew words from the biblical text while discovering Hebrew roots and building a lexicon. The application combines language learning with gamification through root discovery mechanics.

### Key Components and Relationships

#### Core Application Structure
1. **Main Entry Point** ([`src/main.jsx`](src/main.jsx))
   - Wraps the app with `RootDiscoveryProvider` for global state
   - Sets up React rendering

2. **App Component** ([`src/App.jsx`](src/App.jsx))
   - Main container with tab-based navigation (Main, Lexicon, Progress, Full Chapter)
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+3) for tab switching
   - Manages active tab state and renders corresponding panels

#### State Management
1. **RootDiscoveryContext** ([`src/contexts/RootDiscoveryContext.jsx`](src/contexts/RootDiscoveryContext.jsx))
   - Global context for discovered roots and words
   - Persists to LocalStorage with `discoveredRoots` and `discoveredWordsByRoot` keys
   - Tracks new roots for badge notifications
   - Provides functions: `addDiscoveredRoot`, `addDiscoveredWord`, `clearNewRoots`

#### Game Components

## Data Structures

### Words Data ([`src/data/words.json`](src/data/words.json))
- Contains detailed data for 6582 Hebrew words from Genesis 1
- Each word entry includes:
  - `gloss`: English translation/meaning
  - `root`: Hebrew root (3-letter consonantal root)
  - `pos`: Part of speech (noun, verb, etc.)
  - `segments`: Array of word segments (prefix, root, suffix)
    - Each segment has `type` and `letters` array
  - `explanation`: Detailed linguistic explanation
  - `sbl`: SBL (Society of Biblical Literature) transliteration
  - `strongs`: Strong's Concordance number (optional)

### Roots Data ([`src/data/roots.json`](src/data/roots.json))
- Contains detailed data for 52 Hebrew roots found in Genesis 1
- Each root entry includes:
  - `sbl`: SBL transliteration of the root
  - `gloss`: English meaning/gloss
  - `bdb`: Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew lexicon definition
  - `strongs`: Strong's number
  - `explanation`: Comprehensive explanation covering concrete and abstract meanings
  - Examples of roots: "ראש" (head/beginning), "ברא" (to create), "אלה" (God), "ארץ" (earth)

### Verses Data ([`src/data/verses/genesis-1.json`](src/data/verses/genesis-1.json))
- Contains all 31 verses of Genesis 1
- Each verse includes:
  - `verse`: Verse number (1-31)
  - `esv`: ESV (English Standard Version) translation
  - `insights`: Array of theological/linguistic insights for the verse
  - `words`: Array of word objects with:
    - `id`: Word ID matching keys in words.json
    - `sbl`: SBL transliteration
    - `esvHighlight`: Phrase in ESV translation that corresponds to this Hebrew word

### Letters Data ([`src/data/letters.json`](src/data/letters.json))
- Contains Hebrew alphabet information for keyboard display

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. User types Hebrew words from the current verse
2. As words are completed:
   - Word completion sound plays
   - Word is added to discovered words
   - Linguistic insights are shown in carousel
3. When all words containing a particular root are completed:
   - Root discovery sound plays
   - Root is added to discovered roots
   - Root flag animation appears
4. Progress is saved to LocalStorage

### Root Discovery System
- Roots are discovered when ALL words containing that root in Genesis 1 have been typed
- Uses `checkRootCompletion` utility to track completion status
- Newly discovered roots trigger visual and audio feedback
- Discovered roots unlock detailed explanations in the lexicon

### Audio Feedback System
- Multiple sound types in [`src/assets/audio/`](src/assets/audio/):
  - `typing_sound1.mp3`, `typing_sound2.mp3`, `typing_sound3.mp3`: Typing feedback
  - `word_complete.mp3`: Word completion
  - `root_found.mp3`: Root discovery
  - `verse_complete.mp3`: Verse completion
  - `new_word.mp3`: New word discovery
  - `pop-1.mp3` to `pop-4.mp3`: Various UI sounds

### Progress Tracking
- Tracks completed words per verse
- Tracks discovered roots
- Persists progress across browser sessions
- Provides completion statistics

## State Management Patterns

### Context + Reducer Pattern
- **Global State**: `RootDiscoveryContext` manages discovered roots/words across the app
- **Local State**: `GamePanel` uses `useReducer` for complex game state with actions like:
  - `TYPE_CHARACTER`: Handle typing input
  - `COMPLETE_WORD`: Mark word as completed
  - `DISCOVER_ROOT`: Add newly discovered root
  - `NEXT_VERSE`: Advance to next verse
  - `LOAD_PROGRESS`: Load saved progress

### Persistence Strategy
- Dual-layer persistence:
  1. `RootDiscoveryContext` persists discovered roots/words to LocalStorage
  2. `GamePanel` persists game progress (current verse, completed words) separately
- Uses `useEffect` hooks to save on state changes
- Loads from LocalStorage on component mount

### Component Communication
- Parent components pass down state and callbacks
- Context provides global state access
- Custom hooks encapsulate complex logic (e.g., `useProgressPersistence`)

## Known Patterns

### Hebrew Text Processing
- Words are segmented into prefixes, roots, and suffixes
- SBL transliteration used for consistent representation
- Keyboard layout optimized for Hebrew input

### Educational Design
- Progressive disclosure: Basic typing → word completion → root discovery → detailed explanations
- Multiple learning modalities: Visual (typing interface), auditory (sound feedback), textual (explanations)
- Contextual learning: Words learned within biblical verses rather than isolation

### Performance Considerations
- Large JSON data files (words.json is 6582 lines) loaded once
- Lazy loading of audio files
- Efficient root detection with pre-computed data structures

## Solved Problems
- **Import path mismatch**: Fixed import statement in [`src/App.jsx:5`](src/App.jsx:5) from `./components/full_verse/FullChapter` to `./components/full_chapter/FullChapter` after folder was renamed from `full_verse` to `full_chapter`. This resolved the Vite build error "Failed to resolve import".

## Development Notes

### File Organization
- Components organized by feature (main, lexicon, progress, full_chapter)
- Sub-components placed in `sub-components/` directories
- Data files in `src/data/` with clear separation (words, roots, verses)
- Utilities in `src/utils/` for reusable logic

### Code Style
- Functional components with hooks
- Descriptive variable names (e.g., `discoveredRoots`, `completedWords`)
- Comprehensive comments in complex logic areas
- Consistent import organization

### Testing Considerations
- Root detection logic should be unit tested
- Game state reducer should have comprehensive test coverage
- LocalStorage mocking for persistence tests
- Audio playback testing (may require mocking)

## Future Development Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **More Chapters**: Extend beyond Genesis 1 to entire Genesis or Pentateuch
2. **User Accounts**: Cloud sync of progress across devices
3. **Advanced Features**: Word games, quizzes, spaced repetition
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices
5. **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation

### Technical Debt Areas
1. **Large JSON Files**: Consider splitting or lazy loading for performance
2. **Audio Loading**: Preload sounds to reduce latency
3. **State Complexity**: Consider refactoring GamePanel reducer if it grows further
4. **Type Safety**: Add TypeScript definitions for data structures

### Search Algorithm
Weighted scoring system:
- Exact Hebrew root match: 100 points
- Exact SBL match: 80 points
- Gloss contains query: 60 points
- Exact Strong's match: 50 points
- Partial matches in various fields: 15-45 points

### CSS Styling
- Search bar with focus states and clear button
- Search empty state with helpful hints
- Search-matched cards with purple border and glow
- Search relevance indicator bar (top of card)

### User Experience
- Real-time search as you type
- Only searches discovered roots (not all roots)
- Shows results in existing grid view
- Visual feedback for search matches
- Helpful empty state messages

## Supabase Authentication & Progress Saving Implementation (April 2026)

### Overview
Integrated Supabase authentication and cloud progress saving into the Hebrew Bible learning game. Users can create accounts, log in, and have their progress saved to Supabase database while maintaining full localStorage compatibility as fallback.

### Key Components
1. **Supabase Client** (`src/lib/supabase.js`)
   - Configured with environment variables `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Provides authentication and database client for the entire app

2. **AuthScreen Component** (`src/components/ui/AuthScreen.jsx`)
   - Login and signup UI with email/password forms
   - Toggle between signup and login modes
   - Error message display for authentication failures
   - `onAuthSuccess` callback prop for integration with App.jsx

3. **Authentication Wrapper** (`src/App.jsx`)
   - Checks existing session on mount with `supabase.auth.getSession()`
   - Listens for auth state changes with `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()`
   - Shows loading state during initial session check
   - Renders `AuthScreen` when no session exists
   - Passes `session.user.id` as `userId` prop to `GamePanel` when authenticated
   - User info header with sign-out functionality

4. **Progress Library** (`src/lib/progress.js`)
   - `loadProgress(userId)`: Queries `user_progress` table filtering by `user_id`
   - `saveProgress(userId, progress)`: Upserts row to `user_progress` table
   - `formatProgressForSupabase()`: Converts game state to Supabase format
   - `formatProgressFromSupabase()`: Converts Supabase data to game state format

5. **GamePanel Integration** (`src/components/main/GamePanel.jsx`)
   - Added `userId` prop to accept authenticated user ID
   - `useEffect` to load progress from Supabase when `userId` is available
   - `useEffect` to save progress to Supabase when game state changes
   - `LOAD_SUPABASE_PROGRESS` reducer action to merge Supabase data with local state
   - Maintains existing `useProgressPersistence` hook for localStorage

### Data Mapping to Supabase Table
Table: `user_progress`
- `discovered_roots` (jsonb): Array of root objects from `RootDiscoveryContext`
- `completed_verses` (jsonb): Array of verse indices where all words completed (derived from `typedCounts`)
- `word_encounters` (jsonb): Object mapping word IDs to completion counts
- `current_verse_index` (integer): Current verse index (0-based)

### localStorage Compatibility Strategy
1. **Dual Persistence**: Game continues using `useProgressPersistence` hook for localStorage regardless of auth status
2. **Conditional Supabase Operations**: Only run when `userId` is available (authenticated)
3. **Error Handling**: Supabase failures are caught and logged, localStorage continues working
4. **Data Merging**: When Supabase data loads, it merges with existing localStorage data
5. **RootDiscoveryContext Unchanged**: Continues its own localStorage persistence
6. **Initial State Loading**: Always loads from localStorage first, then Supabase if authenticated

### Scenarios Handled
- **Unauthenticated users**: 100% localStorage functionality (unchanged from before)
- **New accounts**: No loss of pre-account localStorage progress (data merging)
- **Network failures**: localStorage continues uninterrupted (error catching)
- **Cross-device sync**: Supabase provides cloud backup with localStorage fallback
- **Existing game logic**: Typing mechanics, verse display, keyboard, sound code remain completely unchanged

### CSS Styling (`src/index.css`)
- Comprehensive authentication styles for `AuthScreen` component
- Loading screen spinner and styling
- User info header and sign-out button styling
- Form styling with focus states and error displays

### Files Created or Modified
**New Files:**
- `src/components/ui/AuthScreen.jsx`
- `src/lib/progress.js`
- `plans/supabase-auth-progress-implementation.md`

**Modified Files:**
- `src/App.jsx` - Authentication wrapper
- `src/components/main/GamePanel.jsx` - Supabase integration
- `src/index.css` - Authentication styles
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Already existed, confirmed properly configured

## Login Functionality Improvements (April 2026)

### Problem Addressed
1. **Registration Flow Issue**: Users saw "nothing happens" after clicking "Create Account" because the system immediately called `onAuthSuccess()` without handling email confirmation.
2. **Progress Tracking**: System saved to both localStorage AND Supabase for authenticated users, conflicting with account-only progress tracking requirement.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Registration Flow
- **AuthScreen.jsx Updates**:
  - Added `showConfirmation` and `registeredEmail` state variables
  - Modified signup logic to show confirmation message instead of calling `onAuthSuccess()`
  - Added confirmation UI with "Check Your Email" message and "Go back to login" button
  - Enhanced login error handling for unconfirmed emails with user-friendly messages
  - Clear form fields after successful registration

#### 2. Account-Only Progress Tracking
- **GamePanel.jsx Updates**:
  - Modified localStorage saving useEffect to skip when `userId` exists (authenticated users)
  - Added `userId` to dependency array to properly trigger/block localStorage saves
  - Ensured authenticated users' progress is saved only to Supabase, not localStorage

#### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- **CSS Updates**:
  - Added `.confirmation-message` styles for better visual presentation
  - Proper styling for email confirmation screen with centered layout
  - Maintained consistent design with existing auth styles

### Key Changes Made
1. **`src/components/ui/AuthScreen.jsx`**:
   - Lines 10-11: Added `showConfirmation` and `registeredEmail` state
   - Lines 26-34: Updated signup logic to show confirmation instead of `onAuthSuccess()`
   - Lines 43-49: Enhanced login error handling for unconfirmed emails
   - Lines 65-85: Added confirmation message UI with "Go back to login" button

2. **`src/components/main/GamePanel.jsx`**:
   - Line 410: Added `|| userId` condition to skip localStorage saving for authenticated users
   - Line 424: Added `userId` to dependency array

3. **`src/index.css`**:
   - Lines 2132-2148: Added `.confirmation-message` styles

### User Flow
1. **Registration**: User signs up → Sees "Check your email" confirmation → Clicks "Go back to login" → Logs in after email confirmation
2. **Progress Tracking**: Unauthenticated users save to localStorage only → Authenticated users save to Supabase only
3. **Error Handling**: Clear messages for unconfirmed email login attempts

### Testing Considerations
- Registration shows confirmation message (not game)
- "Go back to login" button switches to login form
- Form fields clear after registration
- Authenticated users don't save progress to localStorage
- Unconfirmed email login shows appropriate error message

## Email Rate Limit Handling (April 2026)

### Problem
Users experiencing "email rate limit exceeded" errors even with fewer than 3 emails sent, likely due to:
- Supabase free tier limitations
- Rapid repeated attempts
- Shared IP/network limits

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Client-Side Rate Limiting (`AuthScreen.jsx`)
- **Added useRef for rate limiting**: `lastAttemptTime` and `attemptCount`
- **10-second cooldown**: Prevents rapid successive attempts
- **5-attempt limit**: Blocks further attempts for 5 minutes
- **Automatic reset**: Counters reset after 5 minutes of inactivity

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Specific rate limit detection**: Checks for "rate limit", "too many requests", "429" errors
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear explanations about wait times
- **Comprehensive error mapping**:
  - `Invalid login credentials` → "Invalid email or password"
  - `User already registered` → "Account exists, please sign in"
  - `Password should be at least 6 characters` → "Password must be at least 6 characters"

#### 3. Improved Confirmation UI
- **Added helpful hints**: "Didn't receive the email?" section
- **Troubleshooting list**: Check spam, verify email, wait, retry later
- **CSS styling**: Added `.confirmation-hints` and `.confirmation-hint-list` styles

#### 4. Supabase Configuration Improvements
- **Added emailRedirectTo**: Proper callback URL for email confirmation
- **Better error propagation**: More detailed error messages from Supabase

### Key Code Changes

#### `src/components/ui/AuthScreen.jsx`
- **Lines 1-2**: Added `useRef` import
- **Lines 13-15**: Added rate limiting refs: `lastAttemptTime`, `attemptCount`
- **Lines 24-41**: Client-side rate limiting logic (10s cooldown, 5-attempt limit)
- **Lines 55-60**: Supabase rate limit error detection
- **Lines 73-78**: Login rate limit error handling
- **Lines 85-95**: Enhanced error message formatting
- **Lines 108-124**: Added confirmation hints UI

#### `src/index.css`
- **Lines 2149-2172**: Added `.confirmation-hints` styles for better UX

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Prevention**: Users can't spam registration/login attempts
2. **Clear messaging**: Understandable error messages with solutions
3. **Self-service**: Troubleshooting hints in confirmation screen
4. **Graceful degradation**: System handles Supabase limits gracefully

### Testing Scenarios Covered
- Rapid registration attempts (blocked after 5 attempts)
- Quick retries (10-second cooldown enforced)
- Rate limit error from Supabase (user-friendly message)
- Email delivery issues (helpful troubleshooting hints)
- Various authentication errors (mapped to user-friendly messages)
